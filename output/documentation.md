    - Retrieving user details.
    - Updating user information.
    - Deleting user accounts.

### Functionality Summary

The API's functionality is summarized based on unit tests, highlighting key behaviors and edge cases:

- **Image Upload:** Tests the ability to upload an image for a pet, confirming successful uploads with a 200 status code.
- **Pet Addition:** Tests the addition of new pets, verifying the return of a 200 status code and the pet's name.

### Onboarding Guide

For developers new to the Petstore API, here are some key considerations and tips:

- **Authentication:**  The API uses an API key (`special-key`) for testing authorization. This key should be included in the request headers.
- **Data Formats:** Most endpoints handle data in JSON format.  
- **Error Handling:** The API returns standard HTTP status codes for successful operations and errors. See the "Status Code Information" section for details. 
- **Testing:** Use the provided unit tests as examples for integration into your own testing suite.
